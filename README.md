Eras Tour Route Optimization

This project presents a route optimization study for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour. The focus is on maximizing operational efficiency and environmental sustainability in event management.

Objectives
Minimize total distance traveled between concert venues.
Reduce the carbon footprint of the tour.

Methods
Employed Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ) formulation and Fischetti and Tothâ€™s Polyhedral Approach.
Compared these methodologies for their effectiveness in large-scale event planning.

Dataset
Analyzed 20 major stadiums within the United States.
Utilized Google Maps and Bing APIs for geolocation data.

Implementation
Data preparation and transformation using Python Data Analysis Library (pandas).
Optimization models executed using Gurobi.

Results
Identified optimal tour routes.
Demonstrated potential reductions in travel costs and carbon emissions.

Recommendations
Insights for stakeholders in music and entertainment, focusing on sustainable tour planning.
